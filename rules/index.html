<p><h3>Trash:</h3>
<p>Will rate out of 5,
Won't rate simple mods like Turbo'd since it's so basic and easy to achieve, and does what it promisies with ease.
I will not rate a mod unless i've played it (so 3DS mods as of now.)
<p><h3>RATING SYSTEM</h3></p>
<p>1: Terrible. Too many bugs or problems; Unenjoyable for any genre of players; No care put into it.</p>
<p>2: Better, enjoyable and maybe worth your time, but has many problems; Hard to get into.
<p>3: A fun and good experience; Means its worth a try; has average problem count/one bigger problem; Ok; Had Fun.</p>
<p>4: Great experience; Fun for most people; deffinently worth your time; Minimal problems</p>
<p>5: Almost Completley Perfect; MEANS YOU NEED THIS EXPERIENCE; VERY minimal problems.</p>
<p>+0.5: a bit better than previously said; didn't fit the catagory of the original number and means it can be better than stated.</p>
