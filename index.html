<head><h1>4XM</h1>
<p>
<d>	So, what a mod, huh? This mod is very odd, because people either love the
mod, or hate the mod. So I will be going over not just the mod, but
its community. So, lets start with a basic review of the mod. 4XM is
a mod that, in its basis, hopes to bring the gameplay and
competitiveness of Melee to Smash 4. It does this by bringing the
gameplay back the the old characters, and giving melee-theme fighting
style. They also hope to bring balance to the game with its faster
gameplay and gravity change, along with wavedashing, l-canceling, and
shield dropping. That&rsquo;s the basis of what 4xM is built off of.
So, what&rsquo;s the problem with this mod? It&rsquo;s melee. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
you&rsquo;re probably asking. Well, allow me to explain. The game is
meant to play like melee, and if you know, melee isn&rsquo;t the
absolute most balanced game. It has unbalanced hitboxs and an
unbalanced roster. So, it travels over to the mod. Characters are
(while balanced much better than melee) can be odd in matchups and
hitboxes are a little weird. I feel that this isnt a problem. I think
people see this mod as the next PM, and take it seriously at a
competitive level, but in reality, this is just a mod made by people
who has an idea and a dream. This mod, while a little rough around
the edges, isn&rsquo;t finished and (in my opinion) a huge
achievement and just a fun mod. As a melee Mario main, Mario has been
buffed to be more fun and more balanced, which is very important to
having a fun mod, and I feel 4xM does this great. Seeing all these
characters together playing like a game loved and played by many is
great. Seeing something new like this is interesting and fun. It has
problems, but its fun.

<head><h1>SUPER SMASH BROTHERS ALL STARS 0.3.9</h1>
<p>
<d>	Super Smash Bros All Stars is  mod for Sm4sh that hopes to bring the gameplay and look of past games to Sm4sh, and bring the characters
very first appearance back to it’s original look and feel. They also hope to bring previous stages that weren’t brought back to Sm4sh
back, along with various previous versions. Finally, they hope to update the games single player to have a more original feel, with old
and new events. Now, the mod is pretty fun. Its crazy to see N64 Smashs’ polygonal look, Melees’ speedy gameplay, along with its great
stages that missed out on its chance, Brawls gritty, almost realistic style and lighting, and the beautiful look of Sm4sh, alomg with
3DS stages. Yet, as of now, the mod is incomplete and sadly held back by that fact. The main problem I have with this mod as of now is
its gameplay for each character. Each characters gameplay is suppose to represent its original title, and as of now, fails to do that.
I wish that I could have a long and quickpaced combo game like from 64, but I can’t do that, which makes this mod not as fun to play.
I’m unsure if this is possible to change, but its gameplay would be so much more unique if I could z-cancel and Pivot with 64
characters, but didn’t have as many options, especially for airdodge. For melee, I wish I could wavedash and l-cancel, but couldn’t
dacus or Pivot/Perfect Pivot, plus I can get combo’d easily since they’re so heavy. For Brawl, I wish it was super floaty, could dacus
and footstool, but can’t really string combos. Finally, I wish newcomers couldn’t do any new tech and play just like vanilla. I know
its a lot and may not even be the main objective, but it makes the game so much more interesting with its gameplay. Of course, the mods
only %30 done, so I can’t wait to see what they bring to the table gameplay wise instead of some fixed characters, some not worked on,
and everyone can do all the tech. I love what they are doing, but as of now needs a lot of work.

<head><h1>Project Stardust</h1>
<p>
<d>	Now, I don't want to get too contriversal here, so I am going to put this very delicately. Project Stardust is the most boring, 
lazy, and yawnable shit I have ever expirenced in history. Not only is it unoriginal and been done before but 1000x better, but it's
promise of balance is horseshit. It's Sm4sh with PM Turbo, Melee wavedash, and VERY minimal character specific changes. <b> WHY DOES
WAVEDASHING CAUSE LAG?!?!</b> It isn't balanced, it's unfair and unrewarding. Turbo fucks up the game in balance in so many fucking
ways. It's terrible, don't waste your time. It's not balanced, it's boring. Terrible.
  <p>         1/5 (me being VERY nice)       </p>
