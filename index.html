<d>	So, what a mod, huh? This mod is very odd, because people either love the
mod, or hate the mod. So I will be going over not just the mod, but
its community. So, lets start with a basic review of the mod. 4XM is
a mod that, in its basis, hopes to bring the gameplay and
competitiveness of Melee to Smash 4. It does this by bringing the
gameplay back the the old characters, and giving melee-theme fighting
style. They also hope to bring balance to the game with its faster
gameplay and gravity change, along with wavedashing, l-canceling, and
shield dropping. That&rsquo;s the basis of what 4xM is built off of.
So, what&rsquo;s the problem with this mod? It&rsquo;s melee. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
you&rsquo;re probably asking. Well, allow me to explain. The game is
meant to play like melee, and if you know, melee isn&rsquo;t the
absolute most balanced game. It has unbalanced hitboxs and an
unbalanced roster. So, it travels over to the mod. Characters are
(while balanced much better than melee) can be odd in matchups and
hitboxes are a little weird. I feel that this isnt a problem. I think
people see this mod as the next PM, and take it seriously at a
competitive level, but in reality, this is just a mod made by people
who has an idea and a dream. This mod, while a little rough around
the edges, isn&rsquo;t finished and (in my opinion) a huge
achievement and just a fun mod. As a melee Mario main, Mario has been
buffed to be more fun and more balanced, which is very important to
having a fun mod, and I feel 4xM does this great. Seeing all these
characters together playing like a game loved and played by many is
great. Seeing something new like this is interesting and fun. It has
problems, but its fun.
